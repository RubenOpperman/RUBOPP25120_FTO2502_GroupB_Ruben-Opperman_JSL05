# Kanban Board UI Project

## 📋 Project Overview

This project is a fully responsive user interface built based on a Figma design. The main objective was to accurately recreate the layout using HTML and CSS, with a strong focus on clean code structure and responsive styling.

JavaScript has been added to introduce interactivity. The application loads tasks from an array of objects and displays them within their respective columns. When a task is clicked, a modal appears, giving the impression that the task can be edited—however, the edit functionality is not yet implemented.
